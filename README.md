ID413-Information Graphics and Data Visualization
=========

Repository for the course material of ID 413 - M - Information Graphics and Data Visualization at IDC, IIT Bombay

###Course Overview

Information graphics reveal the hidden, explain the complex and illuminate the obscure. Constructing visual representation of information is not mere translation of what can be read to what can be seen. It entails filtering the information, establishing relationships, discerning patterns and representing them in a manner that enables a consumer of that information construct meaningful knowledge.

Recent advances in technology have enabled us with means for creating, recording and analysing incredible amounts of data. Where once data was scarce, it is now available in abundance. The field of Computer Science has made great strides in creating capabilities for data handling and analysis. However the techniques required to most effectively display and communicate data are somewhat neglected. This design course aims to fill the gap by teaching techniques for creating effective visualizations based on principles from graphic design, visual art, perceptual psychology, and cognitive science.
